# Bouncer Buddy  iOS Application  

#### Project description:
The Bouncer Buddy is a facial recognition software and hardware system with which a picture of the customer can be taken and compared to the picture on the ID. The system will then send this input to the cloud which will run a facial recognition comparison between the two images. The output will come back to a live monitor presenting the image and the percentage of certainty on an exact match. This short detour can be used to scan questionable IDs as well as to assist the bouncers in making the decision as to whether the identification is real or not. This device can essentially decrease the amount of underage drinking and bar-going in exchange for a reduction in company losses due to lawsuits and upholding the full extent of the law with an increased accuracy. 

The Bouncer Buddy will utilize cloud technology in order to minimize computing hardware by outsourcing the facial recognition action to a live server. This will allow for an increased accuracy in ID scanning which will mitigate two of an alcohol serving establishmentâ€™s biggest (and most expensive) issues: underage responsibility lawsuits and operating within the boundaries of the law. In addition to this function, the cloud database can be used as an updatable database which collects ID information, and can be used to help local area bars stay on top of underage bar hoppers and repeat offenders. This product is marketable within the boundaries of the law as a lucrative and dependable security assistant. The most important part of maintaining a community is keeping the people safe.
